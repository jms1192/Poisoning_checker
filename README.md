# ðŸ›¡ Solana TX Risk Checker

This tool evaluates the **risk level of Solana transactions** using domain-based address matching and behavioral analysis.

âœ… Built for identifying **dusting attacks**  
âœ… Uses real-time on-chain data from Flipside Crypto  
âœ… Outputs a risk score and label (`High Risk`, `Medium Risk`, etc.) for each transaction  

---

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The tool compares transaction participants based on:
- Partial string matches of `tx_from` and `tx_to` addresses
- Transfer size thresholds (small amounts for potential dusting)
- Wallet funding recency
- Price-weighted volume thresholds

It assigns a score between 0â€“100 and a label indicating the severity of the transaction's risk profile.
